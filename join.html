        <p>TVMK holds regular monthly meetings on the first Tuesday of each month, with special meetings in April for officer installation and the Club's anniversary celebration, and in December for a holiday luncheon. Additionally, optional "Trouble-Shooting Tuesday" meetings provide a space for members to collaborate on solving knitting-related challenges.</p>
        <p>Membership is open to anyone with an interest in machine knitting, whether they own a knitting machine or are considering purchasing one. Prospective members are invited to attend up to two meetings before formally joining, with a requirement to attend at least one general meeting.</p>
        <p>Members are categorized as "Active" or "Associate," with Active members expected to participate in programs, pay dues, and maintain up-to-date personal information through a bio sheet. Associate members, who are former Active members living outside East Tennessee, retain access to newsletters and other Club activities.</p>
        <p>Contact us for more information on joining our next meeting.</p>
